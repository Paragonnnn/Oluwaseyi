        Iâ€™m a frontend developer with a strong passion for creating interactive
        and user-friendly web applications. With experience in HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, React, TailwindCSS, and more, I focus on building seamless
        digital experiences. When I'm not coding, I love exploring new web
        trends, contributing to open-source projects, and continuously learning
        to improve my craft.
